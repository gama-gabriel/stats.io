# Stats.io

This repository contains the code for [Stats.io](https://stats-io.vercel.app), a NBA Guessing Game project.

The objective of the game is to find who the player is only by looking at his stats. The user will have 8 attempts, and with every wrong attempt a new stats is revealed.

The website was built with Next.js, utilizing React and TypeScript.\
It also was developed with Tailwind, guaranteeing responsive layouts.

All of the data necessary to run the app was gathered from [this API](https://nba-players-api-alpha.vercel.app/).\
The API repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gama-gabriel/nba-players-api).
